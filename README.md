**This is the microkernel operating system I made with reference to "30-day self-made operating system" and OSdev firum**

The following modules are mainly implemented:

1. Bootloader
2. IDT/GDT table
3. Support mouse and keyboard interrupt processing
4. Timer
5. Multitasking management
6. Interface controller
7. Terminal Interface and Type,Mem,Dir and other instructions
8. Manually implement context switching and switching between kernel mode and user mode
9. Implement system call functions for displaying characters and creating windows

##Project compilation and running:

Running `run.sh`can automatically compile and start the system kernel, `-d` is the debugging option.

##Project debugging method:

1. Refer to the debugging configuration file `.gdbinit`

```gdb
set architecture i386 //Set the hardware structure of the kernel
target remote localhost:1234
add-symbol-file kernel.elf 0x00280000 //Manually specify the symbol address mapping of ELF (commonly used for QEMU bare metal debugging).This address is usually viewed by the link script. In the bare metal environment, it is the kernel startup address that needs to be manually set. It is useless to use only the file command int the bare metal environment
set disassembly-flavor intel

```

2. Start GDB.When starting GDB, the kernel exectable file must be loaded. In the debugging configuration file `add-symbol-file` will be used  to explicitly specify the actual loading address of the ELF file in memory.

```
gdb kernel.elf -x .gdbinit //Load the symbol table file. The elf file is generated by the linker
```

When debugging, please note that if you need to view the code in the assembly instruction, you need to add it during assembly `-g` compile option (see `makefile` file for details).
